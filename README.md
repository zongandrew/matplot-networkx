This is a repository of examples of using matplotlib and networkx to draw kinds of graphes in Python.

For using matplotlib in python virtualenv, please see: 
https://matplotlib.org/faq/osx_framework.html

`If you absolutely need to use virtualenv rather than venv, `

`then from within the environment you can set the PYTHONHOME environment variable to $VIRTUAL_ENV,`

`then invoke Python using the full path to the framework build (typically /usr/local/bin/python).`
